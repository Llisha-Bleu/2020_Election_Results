## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight on whether

## Project Overview
`Write Overview`

Reason why the topic was selected:
- Current / Trending Topic
- Real Time / Predictor or present camparative data against actual outcome to ...

Questions hoped to answer with the data are:
1. Calculate the total number of Votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes
3. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidates won
4. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
- Data Source: The data was source from KGS reseach, a data collection company that specializes in electorial polling. They played a significant role in collecting polling data throughout the 2020 election cycle.
Each row of the data represents a US state - with `x` states- and includes how many votes candidates got in previous elections, as well as over 100 other attributes, including figures on race, education, earnings, poverty, population, age, health, weather, and more.
- Software: Python 3.7.3, Visual Code, 1.38.1, Tableu for presenting, R studio, Machine Learning, html

 `The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.`

## Machine Learning Model
Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data in from the provisional database 
- Outputs label(s) for input data

## Database
Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the
following:
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database

`Examples:`
-PgAdmin
-MonDB
